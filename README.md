## V2.0.0 Highlights

### üöÄ New Features

- **Media Player Live Activities**  
  Displays compact now-playing info in the notch when media is playing but not expanded.

- **Calendar Live Activities**  
  Heads-up alerts appear in the notch 15m, 5m, and 1m before your next event ‚Äî including countdown mode.

- **Centralized App Environment**  
  SwiftUI environment injection makes state and data flow more robust and scalable.

- **Modular Architecture**  
  Media and calendar systems are now fully modularized for easier maintenance and cleaner transitions.

### üí° UX & Animation Improvements

- **Perfectly Timed Transitions**  
  Matched geometry, spring physics, and new animation helpers ensure buttery smooth expansion/contraction.

- **Live Syncing**  
  Notch state reflects real-time changes from Calendar and Media without needing to hover.

- **Adaptive Layouts**  
  Views now respect notch constraints and prevent visual bounce, overflow, or ghosting.

### üßº Codebase Cleanup

- **Memory & Performance Improvements**  
  All timers, observers, and polling systems now respect lifecycle. Memory leaks resolved.

- **Calendar + Media Overhaul**  
  The entire stack was cleaned up to reduce redundant logic and better handle edge cases.

- **Refined Logging + State Observers**  
  Less spammy logging. Improved real-time debug output for playback, event triggers, and lifecycle changes.
