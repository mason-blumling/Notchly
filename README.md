## Vision

Notchly turns the notch into a dynamic space for productivity ‚Äî blending calendar, media, and live activity intelligence into a beautiful, hover-triggered interface.

## V2.0.0 & V2.5.0 Highlights

### ‚ú® All-New Onboarding

- Modular intro flow driven by SwiftUI enums (`IntroStage`, `LogoAnimationState`)
- Animated path-drawing logo, rainbow transitions, and text reveal using native SwiftUI effects
- Permission request logic that‚Äôs non-blocking, sandbox-friendly, and fully lifecycle-aware

> _See [`fd8b321`](https://github.com/mason-blumling/Notchly/commit/fd8b3210ebcba2aa98da80d6962da98120811a99) for this milestone._

### üöÄ New Features

- **Calendar Live Activities**  
  Pulsing notch alerts appear 15, 5, and 1 minute before upcoming events ‚Äî with countdowns.

  SwiftUI `.environmentObject` injection now powers shared state across the app.

- **NotchlyIntro**  
  A delightful animated experience that introduces users to the notch with custom transitions, spring physics, and state-bound SwiftUI sequences.

### üí° UX & Animation Improvements

- **Perfectly Timed Transitions**  
  Matched geometry, spring physics, and new animation helpers ensure a polished, native feel.

- **Live Syncing**  
  Calendar and media changes update the notch in real time ‚Äî no hover needed.
